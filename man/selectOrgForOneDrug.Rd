specific drug screening}
\usage{
selectOrgForOneDrug(
  drugScreening,
  drugName,
  study,
  screenType,
  doseType = "Averaged",
  quantile = 1/3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{drugScreening}{a single \code{character} string representing the path
and name of the drug screening file that contains the information needed
to run the organoid selection.}

\item{drugName}{a single \code{character} string representing the name of
the drug selected for the analyses. The drug must be present in the drug
screening dataset. The drug name can be found in the 'drug_a' column of the
drug screening dataset.}

\item{study}{a single \code{character} string representing the name of
the study selected for the analyses. The study must be present in the drug
screening dataset. The study can be found in the 'study' column of the
drug screening dataset.}

\item{screenType}{a \code{vector} of \code{character} string representing
the type of
screening selected for the analyses. The type must be present in the drug
screening dataset.  The screenType can be found in the 'screen_type'
column of the
drug screening dataset.}

\item{doseType}{a single \code{character} string representing the type of
dosage selected for the analyses. The type must be present in the drug
screening dataset.}

\item{quantile}{a single positive \code{numeric} between 0 and 0.5
indicating the quantile used to select the organoids. Default: \code{1/3}.}
